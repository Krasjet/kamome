- [Garibaldi](https://www.harbortype.com/fonts/garibaldi/)
- [Graviola Soft](https://www.harbortype.com/fonts/graviola-soft/)
- [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)

You can also find free alternatives. As far as I know, [Alegreya](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) is a good replacement for Garibaldi.
